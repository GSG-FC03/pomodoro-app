# Mohamed Ehab -- 'POMODORO APP'

# The idea of the app
A Pomodoro timer is a simple application that keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively. Traditionally, you have 25-minute focus sessions followed by five-minute breaks and a longer 15-minute break after four consecutive focus sessions.
